# Data Review Process

Date - 18/10/22

## Status
In progress

## Context
When new data is uploaded to the site, it needs to be reviewed by a member of the Vector Atlas team before it is made publicly available.

We need to formalise a process for the review of data uploaded to the site.

## Decision
The review process is shown in the image below:

Additional comments from review:
 - The dataset will be read-only once approved
 - The templates will be available from the site before upload

## Consequences
New stories have been written covering technical implementation of this process.
