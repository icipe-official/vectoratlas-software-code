# Deployment environment

Date - 15/09/22

## Status
Approved

## Context
While the [initial investigation](https://github.com/icipe-official/vectoratlas-software-code/issues/45) in to the possible deployment environments recommended using infrastructure at Oxford, discussions with the Oxford IT team showed that getting access would be difficult. The alternative is to host the environment in Azure run out of ICIPE.

## Decision
We will deploy both the test and production environments out of Azure and run by ICIPE.

## Consequences
ICIPE will need to provision and manage the infrastructure side of the system. ICIPE have already provisioned a test environment at this point in time.
