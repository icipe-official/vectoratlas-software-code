# Database Migrations

Date - ??/08/22

## Status
In progress

## Context
It is currently unclear what the best process for managing the database migrations is. We should investigate the standard options, are SQL scripts enough? TypeORM also offers a migration method in code but this may be more complicated than needed. Whatever method is chosen it needs to be scriptable to aid automation.
