# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

## Status
Accepted

## Context
An architecture decision record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architecture decision made along with its context and consequences. An architecture decision (AD) is a software design choice that addresses a significant requirement. These need enough context so that a future reviewer can understand the reasons for the decision and determine if the decision still stands.

## Decision
We will use ADRs to document these decisions in the Vector Atlas project. We will use [this template](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record/blob/main/templates/decision-record-template-by-michael-nygard/index.md).

## Consequences
All architectural decisions will be recorded in the [ADR folder](../ADRs/).
