# Stats on homepage

## Stories covered
- [31. Display high level stats on homepage ](https://github.com/icipe-official/vectoratlas-software-code/issues/31)


# Prior to demo
1. Ensure API/public/feature_flags for stats is true
1. Ensure you can access the umami API page as well Vector Atlas

## Demo
1. Check out the `main` branch.
1. Briefly cover why we want a stats section on our homepage (evidence of user engagment, community, high level knowledge)
1. Quickly recap what Andrew has covered before. That we are running our own umami server, selected due to GDPR reasons.
1. What types of stats can we pull out - page views, country, events, unique visitors
1. Supplement these with data available in our own db - Number of records, downloads. Again, basic high level stats that allow users to see engagment with the platform
1. Finally, show the stats box on the homepage.
1. Why is it located at the bottom? Why have these stats been chosen? 
1. Highlight that they have been ordered in this manner so as to tell a story about user engagment. People around the world, across many countries, accessing our vector data and pulling it down for use
1. Ask for thoughts? Anything changing, adding removing etc?
