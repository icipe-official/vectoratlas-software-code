# Front-end validation 

## Stories covered
- [172. Add validation messages to the upload page in the UI](https://github.com/icipe-official/vectoratlas-software-code/issues/172)

# Prior to demo
1. Ensure you can spin up dev env and view homepage
1. Ensure data is available for upload/validation and can be quickly manipulate during demo to demonstrate behaviour

## Demo
1. Discuss need for validation. Not just in terms of system but benefit to user experience. Handle errors and guide user instead of throwing useless technical errors back.
1. Navigate to data and select upload
1. You should now see the Upload page with sections for templates and upload
1. Explain the reason for having the templates - ease of use and consistent uploads
1. Why have we ordered the sections in this manner? Again, telling a story. Give the user what they need. Allow the user to upload it. Check it for them and tell them what is wrong
1. Visually, maintained colour scheme of the site. Kept it minimal with strong alignment on LHS and keeping all buttons close
1. Now upload some good data. Show uplaod message and how data now goes off to review process
1. Upload poor data. Remove 1 required field, Latitude, and change a boolean to a 'test'. Ideally across a couple of rows
1. One should now see the user being alerted to errors in their data.
1. Discuss how we have attempted to keep it clean and clear with human readable language.
1. Encourage feedback and further questions
