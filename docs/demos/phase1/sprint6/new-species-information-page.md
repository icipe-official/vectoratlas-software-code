# Prior to demo
1. Ensure test data has been uploaded into the database via http://localhost:3002/species/edit. This will require editor role. 2/3 entries of real species would look good

1. Visit http://localhost:3002/
1. Navigate to More/Species List page
1. Adjust size of window to highlight the arrangement behaviour of the page
