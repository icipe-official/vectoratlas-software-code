- [251. TechDebt: Pull out actions to separate folder](https://github.com/icipe-official/vectoratlas-software-code/issues/251)

## Demo
1. Not an especially exciting demo so may not be worth demo review, but for completeness...
1. Navigate to /home/sanc/vector-atlas/src/UI/state
1. Review each folder and notice how each slice now has a separate actions & utils folder where necessary.
1. Better structure and testing easier
