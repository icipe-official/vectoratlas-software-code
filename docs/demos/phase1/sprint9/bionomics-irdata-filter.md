## Stories covered
- [427. Additional filters - Filter by IR data tyep and presence of bio data ](https://github.com/icipe-official/vectoratlas-software-code/issues/427)


# Prior to demo
1. Check out `main` branch
1. Upload data to highlight workings of the filter - ir_data and bionomicsId in db

## Demo
1. Following feedback from Marianne we were tasked with including ir_data and the presence of bionomics filtering on the map.
1. ir_data can take a number of different values: phenotypic, genotypic, both and none.
1. To cover all these, like the filters before, we use a toggle button to cover all the combinations
1. Show a couple of combinations.
1. Bionomics filtter works similarly. We show all as default and can then filter when buttons are toggled
