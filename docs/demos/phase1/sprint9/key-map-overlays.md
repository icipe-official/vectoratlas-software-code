## Stories covered
- [438. Add key to map for overlays ](https://github.com/icipe-official/vectoratlas-software-code/issues/438)


# Prior to demo
1. Check out `feature/key-map-overlays` branch
1. Ensure an extra model is uploaded. Ideally with a separate colour map

## Demo
1. Explain that for our models we want to have an idea of scale when presented with the colour map - so we need this as part of a legend
1. Each overlay can be manually assigned a colour mapping which will feed through onto the scale
1. Ideally, the user would specify their own colour mapping but the scope of that task would overun the time we have available
