# Vector Atlas Help

Maps are a powerful tool. They can illustrate the distribution of mosquito vector species known to transmit some of the world's most debilitating diseases and highlight where these species are no longer susceptible to the insecticides used as their primary method of control. All evidence-based maps rely on field data collected in a myriad of different ways by multiple data collectors for a wide variety of purposes. In isolation, these data are able to answer the questions they were collected to address, but when combined, their value multiplies. The Vector Atlas is building a data-hub that links 'core' African vector occurrence, bionomics and insecticide resistance data to provide a 'one stop shop' of relatable and cross-referenced data access. Using our standardised and comprehensive collation protocols (Hay et al 2010) to abstract data from the published and grey literature (maintaining all data ownership), we are updating our core datasets (Sinka et al (2010), Massey et al (2016), Moyes et al (2020)) which will expand beyond the dominant vector species to cover the prominent secondary vector species responsible for residual transmission. We are adding locally relevant human community behaviour, local flora (nectar sources) and fauna (livestock). Combined, these data will inform novel spatial models and maps that promote and evolve our understanding of the variables that drive malaria transmission.
