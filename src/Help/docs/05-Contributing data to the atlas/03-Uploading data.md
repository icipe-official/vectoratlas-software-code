## Uploading a template with data

Once you have downloaded and filled in the template, upload it using the `Upload` form on the page.

Select the correct Data Source and Data Type for the uploaded data. The Dataset Id and DOI fields are optional.

If this is a re-upload of reviewed data, input the dataset id in the appropriate field.

If the DOI for this data is known, enter it in the appropriate field. If the DOI already exists in the system, the upload will not succeed.
